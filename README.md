# House-price-prediction





we have taken the dataset from kaggle kc_house_data which
is the same dataset in a previous paper. Since the prediction of house prices relies on a
wide range of criteria that can vary in price depending on location and other
circumstances, house prices will specifically be used as a benchmark for comparison. ,
We added new variables to the local dataset in order to examine the relationship
between these variables and the sale price. We came to a conclusion that our model is
more efficient to predict the price of the house compare to any other model.
